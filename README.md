# HT-after-stroke
The purpose of this work was to develop and validate a model to  predict hemorrhagic transformation (HT)  after endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) in  acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients based on multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 
The single parameter model is DWI as an example. 
Multi-parameter model taking MTT&TTP as an example.
